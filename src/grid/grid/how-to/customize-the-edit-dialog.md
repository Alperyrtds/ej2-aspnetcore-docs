# Customize the Edit Dialog

You can customize the appearance of the edit dialog in the [`actionComplete`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Grids.Grid.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Grids_Grid_ActionComplete) event based on **requestType** as **beginEdit** or **add**.

In the below example, we have changed the dialog's header text for editing and adding records.

{% aspTab template="grid/edit/customizedialog", sourceFiles="*.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}
